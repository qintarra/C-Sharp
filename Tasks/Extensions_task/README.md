## Task

Develop a **MyExtension** class, which declares the following extension methods: 

- the **SummaDigit** method, which extends the Int32 type and returns the sum of the digits of an arbitrary integer. 

- the **SummaWithReverse** method, which extends the UInt32 type and returns the sum of the original positive integer with the number obtained from the original by rearranging all digits in reverse order 

- the **CountNotLetter** method, which extends the String type and returns the number of characters in the string that are not Latin letters. 

- the **IsDayOff** method, which extends the DayOfWeek type and returns the boolean value true if it is a weekend (Saturday or Sunday) or the boolean value false if it is a weekday. 

- the **EvenPositiveElements** method, which extends the IEnumerable <int> type and returns only even positive numbers from a set of integers
