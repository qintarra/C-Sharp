# Extension methods

## Task

Develop a **MyExtension** class, which declares the following extension methods: 

- the **SummaDigit** method, which extends the Int32 type and returns the sum of the digits of an arbitrary integer. 

- the **SummaWithReverse** method, which extends the UInt32 type and returns the sum of the original positive integer with the number obtained from the original by rearranging all digits in reverse order
