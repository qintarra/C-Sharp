## Collections, generics  

### Custom array

Create generic type **CustomArray** – one-dimensional array with a random index range  

**CustomArray** is a collection – array of random type values with fixed length and an original index that the user specifies.  

Example 1: an array of 20 elements length, array values – symbols, the index starts with 18.  

Example 2: an array of 10 elements length, array values – objects of class Animals, the index starts with -5.  

Values of random type can be located in the array, custom first index and the number of elements in the array should be specified while creating. The length and range of indexes cannot be changed after creating. Values of array elements can be set while creating the array and later with the help of the indexer.  

Initial and finite index, array length, and array elements in the form of a standard array Array that starts with 0 can be obtained from the array.
