# While Statements


## Task Description

The task has fifteen sub-tasks in five sections. Each sub-task is a small coding exercise.  

Use the only *while* and *if-else* statements in this task. Using *for* or *do-while* iteration statements is not required.  


### Arithmetic Sequences

An *arithmetic sequence* is an ordered set of terms (numbers) that have a common difference between each consecutive term.

The arithmetic sequence formula is given as,

$`a_{n} = a+(n-1)*d`$

where,
- $`a_{n}`$ is the nth term,
- $`a`$ is the first term, and
- d is the *common difference*
