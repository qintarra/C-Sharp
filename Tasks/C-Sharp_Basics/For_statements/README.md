# For Statements


## Task Description

The task has sixteen tasks in six sections. Each task is a small coding exercise.

Use the only `for` and `if-else` statements in this task. Using `while` or `do-while` iteration statements is not required.


### Arithmetic Sequences

The arithmetic sequence formula is given as,

$`a_{n} = a+(n-1)\cdot{d}`$

where,
* $`a_{n}`$ is the nth term,
* $`a`$ is the first term, and
* d is the common difference.

#### Task 1

Open the [ArithmeticSequences.cs](ForStatements/ArithmeticSequences.cs) file.

Implement the method that returns sum of an arithmetic sequence terms if the common difference is 1.

$`\sum_{i=1}^{n} a+(i-1)\cdot{1}=\sum_{i=0}^{n-1} a+i`$

For the arithmetic sequence $`{5, 6, 7, 8, 9, ...}`$ the sum of the first five elements is 35 (5 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9).

The algorithm you have to implement is shown on the flowchart diagram below. The flowchart notation has no special symbol for a `for` statement, therefore a decision block is used in the diagram.
