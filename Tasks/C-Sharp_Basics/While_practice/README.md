# While Practice


## Task Description

The task has six sub-tasks. Each sub-task is a small coding exercise.

Use the only *while* statements in this task. Using *for* or *do-while* iteration statements is not required.

If you have issues with running test cases for huge _n_ numbers, check your code for _int_ data types and cast values to _double_.


#### Sub-task 1

Implement the method to sum the sequence elements $`^1/_1+^1/_2+^1/_3+...+^1/_n`$:

$`\sum_{i=1}^{n}\frac{1}{i}`$

, where _n_ > 0.
