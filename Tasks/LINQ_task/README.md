Write LINQ queries using extension methods. Each task must be solved with
one LINQ query. Put LINQ expression in the return statement (Look at the template at the end of the task before solving the problem)

## Part Low

### Task 1
The character **C** and a sequence of non-empty strings **stringList** are given.
Get a new sequence of strings with more than one character from the **stringList**, starting and
ending with C.

### Task 2
A sequence of non-empty strings **stringList** is given.
Get a sequence of ascending sorted integer values equal to the lengths of the strings included
in the **stringList** sequence.

### Task 3
A sequence of non-empty strings **stringList** is given.
Get a new sequence of strings, where each string consists of the first and last characters of the
